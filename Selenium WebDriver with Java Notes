Selenium Features 
	Selenium is open source automation testing tool
	It is exclusively for Web Based Application 
	Selenium supports multiple browsers - Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari

Diffrence between Selenium IDE and Selenium Webdriver?
	Selenium IDE :      Selenium IDE is a browser plug-in designed for recording and playing back tests.
	Selenium WebDriver: Selenium WebDriver is a code library of APIs for controlling browsers. 
						Initial version was Selenium Remote control, right now that is deprecated. After that Selenium WebDriver developed.

Why Selenium ? --> It supports multiple platforms, multiple browsers and we can write code in multiple languages. Its open sourse as well

Selenium Web Driver Architecture :
	Once we trigger the test complete selenium code (client) which we have written will be converted to JSON Format
	Generated JSON is sent to Browser Driven (Server) through http protocol
		Note: Each browser contains a separate browser driver
	Browser communicate with its respective browser and executes the commands by interpreting json which It received on the browser.
	Browser Driver receives responses back from the browser and it sends JSON response back to client

** Selenium use w3c / http protocol used to communucate with browser -- standard protocol

Maven repository : this is the library where we can find all java bases libraries
	URL : https://mvnrepository.com/
		: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java
		: Select the latest version which we can see .. https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java/4.25.0

There are two ways to use selenium java
	1) Download all jar files and import in java project
	2) Just copy maven selenium dependencies and place in your java project
		<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java -->
		<dependency>
		    <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
		    <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
		    <version>4.25.0</version>
		</dependency>

How to add Maven in JAVA Project
	Create java project
	Right click on project -> Configure --> Convert to Maven Project
	ADD details like groupID and artifactID

	<dependencies>
	  	<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java -->
		<dependency>
		    <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
		    <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
		    <version>4.25.0</version>
		</dependency>
    </dependencies>
